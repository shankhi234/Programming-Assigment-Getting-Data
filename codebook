##The tidy set was created by
1. Merging the different datasets to create one big datatable
2. The useful information was extracted (mean and std) 
3. The activities were named using the activity names file
4. The dataset was named using the activity names
5. The independent tidy set was created with the averages for each variable

##The R Script, run_analysis.R
The script runs code to complete the different stages of the assignment, 1-5

##The variables
* `xtrain`, `ytrain`, `xtest`, `ytest`, `subtrain`, `subtest`, `activity` and `features` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `train`, `test` are the merged results of their respective datasets
* `total` is the final result of all merged datasets
* `colnames` is the ariable that stores te column names
* `valsneeded` is the subset containing the data required
* `AcNames` store the names of activities
* `TidySet` is the final result and the variable for OBJECTIVE 5
